Red Light Records ]","description":"http://facebook.com/disphonia\nhttps://soundcloud.com/disphonia\n\nhttps://facebook.com/redlightrecords\nhttps://soundcloud.com/red-light-records\n\nBookings : jef@methlab-agency.com\n\nIts banishment had come centuries in the past, exiled to the vast, barren wasteland of Echo Prime – a shadow of itself, depleted of its power. For years it had roamed those lands, subsisting... barely alive... suspended on the edge of the enforced purgatory of eternity. It gathered what it could from this place – every morsel replenishing its being in the smallest of increments. Now, all these years later it found itself at the edge of the parched earth, the haze of the city in the distance... it felt again the power coursing through it, completing it – pulling up the very earth around it with overwhelming ENERGY. Its time had come again - its return would be\nmonumental...\n\nDISPHONIA return with two heavy-hitting tracks filled with the brutally compacted energy of their production hiatus – delivering the pure relentless power of ENERGY with a towering, ethnic-tinged half-step intro that explodes into a full-frontal neurofunk assault. BACK TO THE OLD SCHOOL brings in seasoned MC KRYPTOMEDIC for a nostalgic, yet cutting-edge slice of genre purity, unleashing a high-tech assault on the senses. With this impactful pair of tracks on OPTIV’s breeding ground of talent – RED LIGHT RECORDS – the pair have proven once again their attention to detail and ability to smash the dance. With Energy already supported by Noisia on their radio show and receiving wide acclaim from the d&b sphere – this is a release set to release untold energy into the rave...\n\nARTIST // DISPHONIA \nRELEASE // Energy & Back to the Old School \nLABEL // Red Light Records \nRELEASE DATE // 02.09.2016","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/274361737","user":{"id":689738,"kind":"user","permalink":"disphonia","username":"Disphonia","last_modified":"2016/08/05 10:55:12 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/689738","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/disphonia","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000007635756-51xjkj-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/disphonia/a-disphonia-energy-forth-red-light-records","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000172151024-4xrxav-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/ksC9dck4Ktfn_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/274361737/stream","playback_count":205,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":636,"comment_count":43,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/274361737/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":273120966,"created_at":"2016/07/11 08:14:21 +0000","user_id":1076327,"duration":159126,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":6366480,"last_modified":"2016/07/11 19:07:41 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"gradual \"falling pieces\"","permalink":"gradual-falling-pieces","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://Technique.lnk.to/Summer2016","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Buy / Stream","genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Gradual - Falling Pieces","description":"Out Now:Technique Summer 2016 Album\nFull tracklist & info: bit.ly/Summer2016News\nAll Stores Technique.lnk.to/Summer2016\n\nThe cover art proudly proclaims Technique's Summer 2016 album to be “100% Drum and Bass”. You might be forgiven for thinking that begs more questions that it answers. There's a huge breadth and versatility encompassed within the genre. So, you're left asking, what particular flavour of D&B are we talking about? Well, to answer your query, pretty much all of them.\n\nAcross thirty-seven tracks, Drumsound and Bassline Smith have assembled a cross-section of D&B that only has one thing in common: that summertime vibe. The label bosses themselves roll through with the fluid jungle of the Solah-laced “Cover Our Eyes”, the no-holds-barred funk of “Rise of the Black Panther” and their epic dubwise collaboration with Digital, “First World Problem”.\n\nAnd then there are the big name cameos from artists not normally seen under the Technique banner. Brookes Brothers and Danny Byrd team up with the uplifting drive of “Climb High”, matched in hands-in-the-air power by the euphoric piano of The Prototypes' “Don't Let Me Go”. J Majik recruits 78° and Louie Cabrera for “Day I Left” and “Idcomercial” respectively. And the mighty DJ SS drops an emotively claustrophobic killer in the form of “Expression”.\n\nOf course, the regular regiment of Technique soldiers are present and correct too. Tantrum Desire delivers the tech atmospherics of “Tesoro”, while Kronology subverts the big-room sound with the unpredictable twists and turns of “Everyday”. L Plus backs up rumbling bass and popping beats with entwined chord patterns in “Invincible”. Plus Document One show two different sides to their character, with the jazzfunk vibe of “Klaxon” and the paranoid sci-fi of “Say What”.\n\nAnd we're nowhere near covering everything this album has to offer. From the jungle tear-out of Brian Brainstorm's “Badman Selector” to the minimal magic of Oder's “Mesmerize”, via the liquid purity of Salaryman's “He Knows”, this is a journey that needs to be experienced. Any selection that takes you straight from Fade's “Disco Ball” into Conspire's “Glare of Brass” then to Salaryman's “Synthesized Melancholia” is making a statement about the strength in depth of the D&B genre right now.\n\nIt's all here. This is the whole summertime drum and bass experience cut up into thirty-seven expertly-formed slices which, taken together, represent the full spectrum of what the scene has to offer.

You might be forgiven for thinking that begs more questions that it answers. There's a huge breadth and versatility encompassed within the genre. So, you're left asking, what particular flavour of D&B are we talking about? Well, to answer your query, pretty much all of them.\n\nAcross thirty-seven tracks, Drumsound and Bassline Smith have assembled a cross-section of D&B that only has one thing in common: that summertime vibe. The label bosses themselves roll through with the fluid jungle of the Solah-laced “Cover Our Eyes”, the no-holds-barred funk of “Rise of the Black Panther” and their epic dubwise collaboration with Digital, “First World Problem”.\n\nAnd then there are the big name cameos from artists not normally seen under the Technique banner. Brookes Brothers and Danny Byrd team up with the uplifting drive of “Climb High”, matched in hands-in-the-air power by the euphoric piano of The Prototypes' “Don't Let Me Go”. J Majik recruits 78° and Louie Cabrera for “Day I Left” and “Idcomercial” respectively. And the mighty DJ SS drops an emotively claustrophobic killer in the form of “Expression”.\n\nOf course, the regular regiment of Technique soldiers are present and correct too. Tantrum Desire delivers the tech atmospherics of “Tesoro”, while Kronology subverts the big-room sound with the unpredictable twists and turns of “Everyday”. L Plus backs up rumbling bass and popping beats with entwined chord patterns in “Invincible”. Plus Document One show two different sides to their character, with the jazzfunk vibe of “Klaxon” and the paranoid sci-fi of “Say What”.\n\nAnd we're nowhere near covering everything this album has to offer. From the jungle tear-out of Brian Brainstorm's “Badman Selector” to the minimal magic of Oder's “Mesmerize”, via the liquid purity of Salaryman's “He Knows”, this is a journey that needs to be experienced. Any selection that takes you straight from Fade's “Disco Ball” into Conspire's “Glare of Brass” then to Salaryman's “Synthesized Melancholia” is making a statement about the strength in depth of the D&B genre right now.\n\nIt's all here. This is the whole summertime drum and bass experience cut up into thirty-seven expertly-formed slices which, taken together, represent the full spectrum of what the scene has to offer. It's as simple as that.\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1.\tDrumsound & Bassline Smith – Rise of the Black Panther\n2.\tPolaris – Bring the Heat ft.

Kyrist","description":"Here's a brand new Bassic mix from one of our freshest recruits - Kyrist.\n\nOver the last few years Kyrist has built up a reputation for her trademark style which mainly focuses on the darker and more tech-driven side of drum and bass, and in the process has seen her tunes included in the sets of some of the scenes most respected DJ's.\n\nLabels such as Proximity, Nurtured Beatz, Vandal, Dutty Audio and of course Dispatch have been the foundation of Kyrist's success, and releases on those imprints coupled with her razor sharp mixing skills are the reason why she's so highly rated and heavily tipped as one for the future. However, people won't have to wait long to see what Kyrist has been up to in the studio recently with a Dispatch EP nearing completion and set for release later this year.\n\nFor all booking enquiries please contact tom@bassic.co\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n1.\tLockjaw – Binary Soul [Invisible]\n2.\tQBig & Zenith B – Heptine [Flexout]\n3.\tKyrist – Tangents [Unreleased]\n4.\tKyrist – Emerged VIP [Unreleased]\n5.\tIcicle – Late Hours VIP [Critical Music]\n6.\tDLR & Nymfo – Affliction [Dispatch Recordings]\n7.\tKyrist – Tectonicz [Dispatch dub]\n8.\tPhace & Misanthrop – Non Human [Neosignal]\n9.\tIncognito – Stop & Go [Vandal Records]\n10.\tDLR – Human Error (feat.

Pulsing, vibrating sounds open the track, with effortless doom and eeriness in the background. The tension is built, the beats slowly rising from the ether, before being fully unleashed in the drop. The drums'll get you first, but it's in the layers that Redshift really finds its power. Morganistic are not afraid to add in many different sounds, and they never lose track of their music's togetherness. Slowing things up, they come back with both ease and strength. This really is one hell of a tune, so get ready.\n\n------------------------------\nwww.facebook.com/djoptiv\ntwitter.com/DjOptiv\nFor Bookings contact: tom@gramagency.co.uk\nNorth America: Scott@CyberGrooveProd.com","label_name":"Red Light Records","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2016,"release_month":3,"release_day":7,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246205626","user":{"id":14651,"kind":"user","permalink":"optiv","username":"Optiv","last_modified":"2016/07/30 05:14:14 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14651","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/optiv","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000204273668-ivn6wi-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/optiv/morganistic-redshift","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000146486183-36s3md-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/3TPlSmtnSznr_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246205626/stream","playback_count":4093,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":194,"comment_count":4,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246205626/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":244017832,"created_at":"2016/01/27 09:14:27 +0000","user_id":106369,"duration":122603,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4898576,"last_modified":"2016/02/18 06:12:15 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"project51 borderline gridlok prolix friction \"BBC radio 1\" \"drum and bass\" dnb poisonous","permalink":"gridlok-prolix-poisonous-borderline-remix-friction-bbc-radio-1-edit","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://classic.beatport.com/release/momentus-poisonous-remix/1712509","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Remix ","title":"Gridlok & Prolix - Poisonous [ Borderline Remix ] Friction BBC Radio 1 Edit","description":"Taken from the latest Friction BBC radio 1 show is the forthcoming release on Project 51 by Borderline\nComing Soon.","label_name":"Project 51","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244017832","user":{"id":106369,"kind":"user","permalink":"borderlinednb","username":"Borderline(DNB)","last_modified":"2016/07/26 07:53:05 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/106369","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/borderlinednb","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000179758265-cx6kpj-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/borderlinednb/gridlok-prolix-poisonous-borderline-remix-friction-bbc-radio-1-edit","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000144769572-5x9741-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/IgOBcGXtHzCR_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244017832/stream","playback_count":11324,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":809,"comment_count":32,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244017832/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":246512571,"created_at":"2016/02/11 11:20:48 +0000","user_id":106369,"duration":109070,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4357784,"last_modified":"2016/02/18 06:11:59 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"project51 gridlok borderline dnb neurofunk","permalink":"borderline-momentus-project-51-out-180216","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://classic.beatport.com/release/momentus-poisonous-remix/1712509","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Borderline - Momentus [ Project 51 ] Out 18.02.16","description":"Forthcoming on Project 51 - Out 18.02.16 \n\na.

DLR & Nymfo \"Affliction\"\nB1. Nymfo & Total Science \"Forward Motion\"\nB2. Nymfo \"Marching Machines\"\nC [digital bonus]. \"Pitchfork\"\n\nOur first outing on the main Dispatch label in 2016, we are pleased to welcome back Nymfo for his debut EP; a fearsome four tracker entitled ‘Marching Machines’.\n\nThe EP succeeds two superb singles from the Dutchman, with an infectious style that catches us every time; uncompromising on the lower frequencies, but always funk induced; controlled technical mid ranges are used strictly to facilitate the groove; never excessive or superfluous.\n\nNymfo combines forces with label stalwart DLR on opening track ‘Affliction’, which true to its title, inflicts its deadly scourge from the off, with flashing sirens giving an air of anarchy and disorder; developing throughout, with ultra-crisp drums pattering and shifting over.\n\nUp next is ‘Forward Motion’, which sees Nymfo collaborate with the mighty Total Science for the very first time, in a tantalizingly dark manner. Pushing the speakers to the threshold, the bassline carries through with formidable force, as vocal snippet ‘Forward’ echoes atop.\n\nFollowing on, is title track ‘Marching Machines’, setting the tone for the EP as mechanical whirrs murmur over playful, skipping drum work. Equipped with carefully selected samples, the track combines numerous elements, whilst offering space in all the right spaces to reach its goal.\n\nLast but certainly not least, ‘Pitchfork’ completes the EP, since first featuring in his Radio 1 mix back in August. Paying homage to the ‘Wormhole’ sound of the 90s, Nymfo gives his own distinctive future twist to a classic style; increasing the intensity, but retaining all the groove. \n\nOrder links:\n• Dispatch store (Early release + free digital files with vinyl purchases): http://bit.ly/dis096\n• Bandcamp (Early release + free digital files with vinyl purchases): btprt.dj/1LjmeIa\n• Beatport (digital): btprt.dj/1TEc1aw\n• i-Tunes (digital): smarturl.it/DIS096\n• Redeye Records (vinyl): bit.ly/1RRJ5MP\n• Juno (vinyl): bit.ly/20CUNdU\n• Juno Download (digital): bit.ly/20Yl5wC","label_name":"Dispatch Recordings","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2016,"release_month":2,"release_day":26,"original_format":"mp3","license":"cc-by-nc-sa","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244071415","user":{"id":66177,"kind":"user","permalink":"anttc1","username":"Dispatch Recs | Ant TC1","last_modified":"2016/07/30 05:09:40 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/66177","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/anttc1","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000153654110-2pelef-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/anttc1/nymfo-total-science-forward-motion-dispatch-recordings-096-clip","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000144814730-c2tec7-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/DjWef7AVZAEW_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244071415/stream","playback_count":9589,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":756,"comment_count":18,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244071415/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":176375505,"created_at":"2014/11/11 11:25:44 +0000","user_id":97129789,"duration":81796,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":3271683,"last_modified":"2016/03/02 15:32:02 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"drum n bass\" dnb synapse Dark \"inna Rhythm\" label Jungle Tech","permalink":"synapse-organism-clip-forthcoming","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"https://pro.beatport.com/release/the-realm-vol-1/1463390","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Neurofunk","title":"Synapse - Organism (The Realm EP)","description":"Dark thumping neuro from SYNAPSE.

The anticipation around this second album is only growing, having scored three Beatport numbers ones with their latest singles. On top of playing sold out shows at Brixton Academy, as well as festivals across the Atlantic and singles and producing remixes on major labels, it’s clear to see how they’ve met these benchmarks. \n\n‘Cloud 9’ sees Calyx back on vocals, adding a soulful depth which creates a narrative behind the music. Carefully drawn out lyrics create a cinematic edge, intimate and adding an 80’s new wave flare which is seldom seen within the genre. Layers gradually build underneath the track’s more humanistic elements, with a distorted bassline revving up and peddling the record forward. Ducking and diving between twisted beats, you’re launched through a segment of glitchy sonic, before stockier subs underpin the composition. A testament to an unbreakable production standards, it only alludes to another studio album set to make history.\n\nThe name ‘Panic Attack’ in itself is foreboding; implicating an explosive flipside, it delivers with an almighty kick and leaves you reeling. Snapping and kicking between hi-hats and low-mids, ‘Panic Attack’ is explosively aggressive from its roll out. Winding up on elongated note patterns and quaking percussion, the erratic break pushes you through a soundscape of madness. However, this is one methodically built… Keeping you hooked from start to finish with pounding drum loops. An incredible verification of their technical knowledge, this isn’t just the groundwork for a second studio album.

You've probably noticed that, over the last few years, Technique Recordings has been instrumental in bringing a host of international talent to wider prominence in the scene. Names like L Plus, MaxNRG, Spectrem and Document One are now regular fixtures on the tracklists of top echelon DJs for raves and radio alike. So, fresh for 2015, here's the latest addition to this fast-expanding global operation. Meet Gradual.\n\nIf you've been paying attention to the tightly-knit Spanish D&B scene, then you'll already know about the DJs and producers called Alerstorm and Ice Stereo. And you'll know they've been steadily building their skills and profile for around seven years, dropping heavy releases on multiple imprints across Europe. If, however, you haven't been paying attention then you may have formed your own misguided idea of what Spanish D&B is all about. Maybe some laid-back, sun-kissed Mediterranean vibes with a bit of classical guitar thrown in? Well, check your prejudices and think again.\n\nThese two have been ripping things up with their own brand of dark, deep and complex tear-out neuro-influenced drum and bass. They've given us force-laden rhythmic motifs folded and reshaped into multiple forms with layers of effortlessly technical bass and devastatingly powerful riffs. They've given us tight and aggressive drums that punch right in the solar plexus. That's the style that's seen Alerstorm and Ice Stereo cement their status in the world of D&B. When, three years ago, they recognised their complementary perspectives and began collaborating, it was clear that this team-up had the potential for even bigger things.\n\nAnd those bigger things have arrived in the form of a signing to Technique Recordings. Gradual, as the duo are now known, are now trained and ready to flex their skills for a wider audience than ever before. Here are two producers who've paid their dues and are prepared for Technique to take them to the next level. It's time for Spanish D&B to take its place on the big stage and show us all what it's really made of.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nVolatile Cycle - Keep Steppin (Original Mix) \n\nCause4Concern - Lowlife (Maztek Remix)\n\n\nDabs - Grindwerk Ft.

And after dominating the Beatport Top 100 with their most recent single ‘A Day That Never Comes / Snakes & Ladders’, they won’t be applying the brakes anytime soon, especially in the lead up to their greatly anticipated second album on the Ram imprint.\n\nBack on vocal duties, Calyx demonstrates the pair’s multi-dimensional approach to beat making. With plucky percussion relaying you through bouncing subs and a drivingly solid bassline, it defines their vast repertoire of style. They’re not scared to dip into unfamiliar territories, with Calyx’s cool vocals sitting on top of lulling guitar rhythms to provide the first part of a diverse and brilliantly crafted record. \n\n‘Sawn Off’ rolls out next; it’s a grittier track than its predecessor, with a conundrum of hi-hats and aggressive drum patterns. Pounding pads take you towards a colossal break, heighten by the effect of a cleverly placed sample. The track ricochets throughout, not losing momentum or impact, with an intricately weaved structure, one only achievable by a team who’ve been running the game for decades.  \n\nWith an album laying just out of reach, each single is bringing us closer and closer to the inevitable. All four tracks prove they’re still a formidable force to be reckoned with; this LP will only emphasise that fact. \n","label_name":"Ram Records","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2015,"release_month":6,"release_day":7,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208751467","user":{"id":518837,"kind":"user","permalink":"calyxteebee","username":"Calyx & TeeBee","last_modified":"2016/04/28 15:56:25 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/518837","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/calyxteebee","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000061005523-plwj35-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/calyxteebee/sawn-off","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000119151728-ile7vw-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/PeN4PkIWnaXn_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208751467/stream","playback_count":257744,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":9227,"comment_count":146,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208751467/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":203576703,"created_at":"2015/05/02 13:00:52 +0000","user_id":7590998,"duration":3139663,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":125641864,"last_modified":"2015/09/23 09:53:40 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"dnb drumandbass D&B drumandbasics exclusive","permalink":"drumbasics-exclusive-guest-mix-philth","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"PHILTH","title":"Drum+Basics Exclusive Guest Mix: PHILTH","description":"\n30 Minutes of Philth - May 2015\n\n1) Mefjus ft Zoe Klinck - Blame You (Ivy Lab remix)\n2) DLR - Ask The Question (instrumental mix)\n3) Safire ft Morph - Deep Architect\n4) Noisia, Hybris & Mefjus - Clusterfunk\n5) Lockjaw - Ghost in the Machine\n6) Emperor - Passed Up\n7) Noisia and Phace - Program\n8) Philth - Fire\n9) Octane and DLR ft Gusto - Gravity\n10) Survival and Silent Witness - Trust No One\n11) Current Value - Whiplash\n12) Noisia, Hybris & Mefjus - Reptilians\n13) Emperor - SMPL\n14) Impish - Friday\n15) Bassment - Integral\n16) Reckei - Can’t Get None\n17) Philth - Souzou VIP\n18) HLZ - Dying Memories\n19) Future Cut - Whiplash\n20) Martyn nytraM - Hellfire Club\n21) HLZ - Eyes of Silver\n22) Ed Rush and Optical - Watermelon\n23) Noisia - Banshee\n24) HLZ - Duel\n25) Xtrah - Operator\n26) Ed Rush and Optical - Alien Girl\n27) Philth and Agman Gora - Incantation\n28) Bad Company - 4 Days\n29) Friction and Prolix - Dark Moves\n30) Reso - Move\n31) Philth - Cosmos\n32) Noisia and Phace - Floating Zero\n","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203576703","user":{"id":7590998,"kind":"user","permalink":"drumandbasics","username":"drumandbasics","last_modified":"2016/07/21 10:10:22 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/7590998","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/drumandbasics","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000006949994-yuderx-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/drumandbasics/drumbasics-exclusive-guest-mix-philth","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000115374014-adxbdp-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/157rn7NQxcV4_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203576703/stream","download_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203576703/download","playback_count":3806,"download_count":283,"favoritings_count":252,"comment_count":25,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/203576703/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":204073078,"created_at":"2015/05/05 20:04:56 +0000","user_id":24097,"duration":120643,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":1930870,"last_modified":"2015/05/05 20:11:08 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"insideout","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Optiv & BTK - Inside Out","description":"Dive Bomb EP @ Virus Recordings\n\n2x12\" Vinyl Pre-order @ Redeye Records - http://tiny.cc/0pgrxx\nRelease date: 15 June 2015\n\nComing next on the always massive Virus Recordings is the Dive Bomb EP from Optiv and BTK.

Encompassing his trademark uncompromising dance floor style as well as explorative sonic journeys into elaborate textured sound design and hip hop fused productions.\n\nBased around the concept that we as a species have come to a point in our own evolution where man, machine and spirituality have all merged together, Maztek’s aptly named ThreePointZero explores the relationship between the real and the cyber world.\n\nFeaturing an array of well-chosen collaborations of both vocalists and producers alike – such as Dutch hip hop crew Dope D.O.D, Hardware / Virus’s BTK, Viper’s Insideinfo, Ram’s Audio, Italian new blood Disprove and vocalist; Coppa. Maztek has created a cogent and extremely innovative long player that once again proves why DnB will never die.\n\nIn his own words: ‘Three Point Zero represents something new to me, moving from 2.0 to 3.0. It relates to the \"cyber\" life we all now lead in one way or another. 3.0 could also reference the next stage in human evolution. Where the body, spirituality and technology combine. Human 3.0, when a man becomes his own Prophet.’\n\n-Maztek\n\nThis sampler provides an entry point into what to expect from the full album, which will be released in early December.","label_name":"Renegade Hardware","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2014,"release_month":11,"release_day":24,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178401248","user":{"id":51145,"kind":"user","permalink":"maztek","username":"Maztek","last_modified":"2016/08/08 13:46:18 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/51145","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/maztek","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000215959830-9mfhjj-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/maztek/time-gap","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000099071438-5d1nfl-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/71v9fiQ7e0Ag_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178401248/stream","playback_count":8176,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":257,"comment_count":14,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/178401248/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":177708349,"created_at":"2014/11/19 20:54:33 +0000","user_id":89637,"duration":2762550,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":110492408,"last_modified":"2015/11/01 09:54:56 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"Drum & Bass\" drumnbass Jungle breakbeat edm newfounddialect \"commercial suicide\" headz metalheadz break dispatch kmag theinvaderz \"the invaderz\" breaks","permalink":"kmag-mix-november-2014","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"invaderz","title":"The Invaderz KMag Mix November 2014","description":"","label_name":null,"release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177708349","user":{"id":89637,"kind":"user","permalink":"invaderzdj","username":"The Invaderz","last_modified":"2015/08/24 11:46:14 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/89637","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/invaderzdj","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000106841555-5cali8-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/invaderzdj/kmag-mix-november-2014","artwork_url":null,"waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/NVI1R5PbwXCn_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177708349/stream","playback_count":3076,"download_count":100,"favoritings_count":176,"comment_count":17,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/177708349/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":176575878,"created_at":"2014/11/12 16:20:57 +0000","user_id":3890696,"duration":264931,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":10599362,"last_modified":"2015/04/21 11:37:32 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Stealth Alliance EP Revival Bulgan Everytime \"The Passenger\" \"Dirty hertz\" Xtrah Stylus Quaed Program \"Ram Records\" \"Andy C\"","permalink":"stealth-alliance-ep-mini-mix","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Stealth - The Alliance EP - Mini Mix","description":"Stealth - Alliance EP - Program\n\nWorldwide Release:  16th November \n\nWith each release, Stealth has slowly made his presence known within your musical subconscious. Taking hold of every synapse with drops of LFO induced devastation he’s now merged with the other figureheads of a dnb underworld to bring you his ‘Alliance EP’. And believe us when we say, this is one not to miss. \n\nAlready firmly asserting himself amongst the Program roster, his meticulously crafted cuts have helped push the imprint as an underground tastemaker. And the unstoppable partnership is back, with a gritty and technically adept EP… Proving once again they're a force to be reckoned with. \n\nRolling up first alongside Stealth is Dirty Hertz, with the two producers proving their flare for contemporary drum and bass.  Renowned for their intricately layered composition, ‘Revival’ is both uncompromising and delicately woven. Vigorously snapping hi-hats help to underpin an aggressive bassline, moving along a construction line gradually being built upon between pounding subs. It’s the perfect starter, helping to epitomise the sound Program represents; Aggressive musicality that boasts of ingenuity… the type that often goes unrivalled.\n\nThen we're introduced to Stealth & Xtrah’s ‘Everytime’. As you’d expect, this track is totally different from its predecessor, although it’s just as precisely orchestrated. Pushed forward by domineering drum loops, Stealth’s style oozes in between each bar; it’s a frequency that drops dangerously low.  Wraith-like vocals dip in and out of the record’s stockier elements, with a juxtaposition which is tasteful whilst still making an impact. \n\nStealth and Stylus have already proved their working dynamics result in epic sound clashes and ‘Bulgan’ is no different. Building with intensity, there’s all out anarchy as it dives into a steppy riddim. This is then diced up by randomly ducking, skipping samples and winding breaks. With quickly zipping beats helping to pad out its configuration, there’s no mistaking the intricacy between every break. Stealth and Stylus smash it once again and they guarantee something new with every listen.\n\nLastly, Stealth and Quaed take the stand with ‘Passenger’. A demonstration of Stealth’s dynamics, the two begin with an intimidating fluctuation of note patterns overlaying a cinematic entrée. Metallic drums pound in between sections, creating a hard-driven melody which pulls you through a sonic-rollercoaster of sound. The perfect way to wrap up four sonic assaults, look no further for tracks to pull you into the season’s darker months.\n\nA host of alliances from one of Program’s finest Stealth unleashes another defiant slab of bass. It’s the lead up to his debut album, a step towards another phenomenal release from the artist. \n\nSo once again, it’s time to get with the Program… a catalogue that never disappoints.\n\n Stealth\n\n1: Revival & Dirty Hertz 2: Everytime & Xtrah 3: Bulgan & Stylus 4: The Passenger & Quaed ","label_name":"Program","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2014,"release_month":11,"release_day":14,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176575878","user":{"id":3890696,"kind":"user","permalink":"stealthdnb","username":"Stealth DnB","last_modified":"2016/04/21 17:12:30 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/3890696","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/stealthdnb","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000057198142-xmsdk4-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/stealthdnb/stealth-alliance-ep-mini-mix","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000096937121-jec7yc-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/HVG5gKujbamy_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176575878/stream","playback_count":52676,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1504,"comment_count":64,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/176575878/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":176705246,"created_at":"2014/11/13 11:17:59 +0000","user_id":434854,"duration":429127,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":17215159,"last_modified":"2016/03/02 15:32:02 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"\"Ram Rewind\" \"Ram Records\" \"Ram Trilogy\" Titan","permalink":"ram-trilogy-titan-ramrewind","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.ramrecords.com/shop/download/ramm28d","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Buy from RAM","genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Ram Trilogy - Titan #RamRewind","description":"Up next from RAM Rewind we have the one and only title-track from RAM Trilogy’s ‘Titan’ EP.

Tiamat [SAMPLER EXCLUSIVE TRACK]\nCern | B1. What We Bring Upon Ourselves\nCern | B2. Conway\n\nRelease Date | 22/09/2014\n\nSetting the wheels in motion for his forthcoming “Under Another Sky LP”, Cern opens his 2nd studio album with three teaser tracks to wet your beak. An artist who never shies from experimentation, whilst consistently striking a chord deep down, Cern offers a sample of the damage, reflection and reconstruction that lies ahead.\n\nStarting things off with a track exclusively available for this album sampler, “Tiamat” loosens the reigns and unleashes a storm that matures below the surface, retaining composure and clout all the while. Named after an ancient goddess that embodied primordial chaos, Cern engineers a perfect set opener with precision; low ends striking right at the chest.\n\nAs the dust clears in the aftermath of bedlam, the tempo relaxes somewhat as we are welcomed by “What We Bring Upon Ourselves”. The orchestral introduction is profound, yet cautious and thought-provoking. Delicate strings and serene chords evoke a warm glow, enveloping vinyl crackles in a truly sublime musical interlude.\n\nThis leads smoothly into the superbly layered “Conway”, which picks the pace back up, but teasing, in playful, almost tormenting fashion. Initially subtle and ultra-stripped, it quickly gathers momentum with menacing drive. Breathtaking amen flashes emerge sporadically, before retreating to minimal flickers; masterfully controlling the dance.\n\nOrder links:\n• Dispatch store (early vinyl + free digital WAVs / MP3s): bit.ly/1pQrJ4u\n• Dispatch store (digital): bit.ly/1u5gBzS\n• i-Tunes (digital): smarturl.it/DISCELP001S\n• Juno Download (digital): bit.ly/1t7hryY\n• TrackItDown (digital): bit.ly/VKZacl\n","label_name":"DISPATCH RECORDINGS","release":null,"track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168133606","user":{"id":169767,"kind":"user","permalink":"cern","username":"Cern","last_modified":"2016/06/10 11:31:27 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/169767","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/cern","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000198083323-6tm9t0-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/cern/tiamat-dsipatch-sampler-exclusive","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000091290168-9u9v0c-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/hEqQqXHt6Q7f_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168133606/stream","playback_count":7112,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":224,"comment_count":15,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/168133606/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":164666017,"created_at":"2014/08/25 09:22:08 +0000","user_id":24097,"duration":327343,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":13081300,"last_modified":"2016/04/23 18:10:12 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"frenzymode","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/aftershock-series-ep-volume-5/1371330","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Black Barrel - Frenzy Mode [ Dutty Audio ]","description":"V/A - Aftershock Series EP Volume 5 [ Dutty Audio ]\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n\r\n@Artifact - Surveillance\r\n@BlackBarrelspb - Frenzy Mode\r\n@Kantyze - Morning Shake\r\nUnder Pressure - Stompa\r\n@Williamhine (Whiney) - Just Leaving\r\n@Wintermutednb & @Amon-Bay - 8 Fall\r\n\r\nRelease date: September 22nd 2014 \r\n---------------------\r\nFor bookings contact: butoke@gmail.com\r\n---------------------\r\nfacebook.com/djbtk\r\nyoutube.com/viniciushonorio\r\ntwitter.com/vinibtk","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164666017","user":{"id":24097,"kind":"user","permalink":"viniciushonorio","username":"Vinicius Honorio","last_modified":"2016/08/05 21:31:06 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/24097","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/viniciushonorio","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000232912682-9h2s3h-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/viniciushonorio/frenzymode","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000089059980-thgsc7-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/QkuFIPBr0DY4_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164666017/stream","playback_count":17210,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":624,"comment_count":38,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/164666017/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":165155677,"created_at":"2014/08/28 14:02:33 +0000","user_id":24097,"duration":2950206,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":117894744,"last_modified":"2015/11/15 10:27:37 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"daudiopodcast011","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Dutty Audio Podcast 011","description":"Dutty Audio Podcast 011\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.

They've toured around the world, with highlights including Glastonbury and numerous other festival appearances, and continue to build on their growing reputation as some of the most exciting and consistent performers in the scene.\r\n\r\nFrom their base in Utrecht, Holland, the Black Sun Empire trio have truly gone global, taking their own brand of high-octane techno-infused drum & bass to audiences worldwide, with over 100 appearances at live stages and clubs in the last year alone.\r\n\r\nTheir own club night, Blackout, celebrated it's ninth year anniversary in February 2012 and has seen guest appearances from some of the very best artists in drum & bass and dubstep including Goldie, Dom & Roland, Klute, Optical, Spor, Nero, and Bar 9. In 2011 and now onto 2012, Blackout goes on tour with guests and related artists from their three labels (BSE Recordings, oBSEsessions, Shadows of the Empire) and now has a highly successful residency in London at Cable.\r\n\r\nSome of the artists who played at Blackout are:\r\n\r\nNoisia, Audio, Jade, Nymfo, SPL, State of Mind, Ed Rush, CounterStrike, Gridlok, Dom & Roland, Calyx, Spor, Klute, Concord Dawn, Eye-D, Teebee, Chris.Su, Vicious Circle, Break, The Upbeats, Phace, Optical, Bad Company, Total Science, Matrix, Futurebound, Brookes Brothers, Fresh, Mindscape, Spectrasoul, Ulterior Motive, Dieselboy, Optiv, Cause4Concern, Andy C, Goldie, Camo&Krooked, Marcus Intalex, Prolix, Bar9, N-type and many more.\r\n\r\nThis podcast serie is all about that sound! \r\nSubscribe to the channel if you want to say informed!\r\n","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"podcast","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147691240","user":{"id":30296,"kind":"user","permalink":"blacksunempire","username":"Black Sun Empire","last_modified":"2016/08/15 05:06:13 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/30296","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/blacksunempire","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000153644672-bzxd92-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/blacksunempire/bse-podcast-029","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000078319884-b29zcl-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/kvQqhQWrDSsT_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147691240/stream","download_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147691240/download","playback_count":67294,"download_count":6842,"favoritings_count":2404,"comment_count":282,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/147691240/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":148353485,"created_at":"2014/05/07 14:19:24 +0000","user_id":27796673,"duration":59851,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":2392916,"last_modified":"2016/05/16 14:33:00 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Fre4knc Cardiome Nick \"Abstract Elements\" \"Invisible Recordings\" Noisia \"Bass Music\" Beats","permalink":"fre4knc-cardiome","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://open.spotify.com/user/invisiblerecordings/playlist/3ohyowDZfdBsIwxPwYlBNa","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Listen on Spotify","genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Fre4knc -

An essential sun-kissed calendar date for artists, industry influencers and enthusiasts alike... Whatever your genre persuasion, if you're serious about the dance then Miami welcomes with you open arms. David Beckham's not the only Brit taking over Miami this winter!\r\n\r\nRam Records have represented at this annual meeting of musical minds since day one. Cutting through dance music's ever-changing fads and flavours with their demonstrative D&B message, they have achieved a rock-solid standing as the most important drum & bass event there. With over a thousand parties happening throughout the event -- from VIP pool parties to the epic multi-arena beast Ultra -- Ram have worked hard to create this sterling reputation. \r\n\r\nThis year will be no exception: the label have secured another session at Mekka. One of Downtown Miami's most desired venues, it will be home to RAMiami with a line-up that reads like a who's who in D&B: Andy C, Ed Rush & Optical, Wilkinson, Loadstar, Rene LaVice and Delta Heavy.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate, they've curated 'RAMiami 2014'. Just like their Mekka mission, it's an all-star cast that represents the broadest scope and most vibrant colour of drum & bass. It's yet another reminder of how extensive and timeless Ram's repertoire truly is.  \r\n\r\nShowcasing drum & bass's unique melting pot with depth and clarity, every possible style can be enjoyed on 'RAMiami 2014': The spine-melting euphoria of Loadstar's 'BLVD'. The dreamy melodic textures of Culture Shock's 'Ohrwurm'. The grizzle-bass badness of Noisia's 'Façade VIP'. The ludicrous rudeness of Roni Size's 'Hotness' remix. The organic instrumentation of Sub Focus's 'Flamenco'. The savage steel drum  of Moving Fusion's 'Chilli Pepper'... The list goes on.\r\n\r\nNo Ram album is complete without exclusives, too. And amongst this explorative 16 track tale you'll find three next-level specials that are unavailable anywhere else. Recent Drum&BassArena Artist Of The Week Salaryman dusts his jazz piano and slinky double bass off for 'My Future'. Mob Tactics, meanwhile, deliver the dark and devious 'Joe Mangle'. Boasting multi-faceted bass textures and a switch-flipping dynamic on the drop, it's one of the duo's best tunes to date. The third exclusive comes from Bluescreens. Last spotted on Ram's 'RAMsterdam 2013' album, here we find them developing their full-throttle audio adventure 'Strike One' with a spectacular second part. Flexing a muscular bassline and raw, pummelling drums, it's a fittingly dramatic finale to yet another exciting, extensive Ram collection.  \r\n\r\nMiami wouldn't be the same without Ram's heavyweight presence. Both their Mekka line-up and this collection of exclusives and timeless classics show exactly why.           \r\n\r\nDJ Support: \r\nChase & Status Loadstar, Mind Vortex, Optical, Zeds Dead, El Hornet, Specrtrasoul, S.P.Y  Calvertron, Chords, Shock One, Crissy Criss, Drumsound, EastColors, Rene LAvice, Futurebound, High Contrast, Nu Tone, Doc Scott, TC, Dillinja, Sub Focus, Ed Rush, Taxman\r\n\r\nlove it - Chase & Status\r\nDope!! - Zeds Dead\r\nClass A ! - elhornet\r\nMassive, Vibes from Bluescreens! - Chords\r\ngnarrrrly - Shock One\r\nMy future is such a tune, love it - S.P.Y\r\nLovely Calibresque tune by Salaryman, will play for sure - High Contrast\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Ram YouTube - http://po.st/SubscribeRamYT\r\nBecome a fan of RAM Records: http://po.st/LikeRamFacebook\r\nFollow RAM Records on Twitter: http://po.st/FollowRamTwitter\r\nRAM Website - http://ramrecords.com","label_name":"RAM","release":"RAMMLPD8","track_type":"original","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140400855","user":{"id":434854,"kind":"user","permalink":"ramrecords","username":"RAM Records","last_modified":"2016/05/18 09:21:53 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/434854","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000182048273-qa289q-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords/bluescreens-strike-one-part-ii","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000074005210-7nrhkk-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/NS0BUiJc5Jxn_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140400855/stream","playback_count":16550,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":670,"comment_count":32,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140400855/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":104402168,"created_at":"2013/08/07 14:34:07 +0000","user_id":2330284,"duration":1502338,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":60087901,"last_modified":"2013/08/07 15:04:29 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"grand-theft-auto-iii","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"","title":"MC Codebreaker and DJ Timecode - MSX FM","description":"DJ: MC Codebreaker and DJ Timecode\r\nGenre: Drum and Bass, Jungle","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/104402168","user":{"id":2330284,"kind":"user","permalink":"sipy","username":"sipy","last_modified":"2016/03/25 11:09:21 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/2330284","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/sipy","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000049727934-rrvpov-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/sipy/grand-theft-auto-iii","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000054737930-4lsvv9-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/Bt0NcuoMP0f4_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/104402168/stream","playback_count":1057,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":24,"comment_count":1,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/104402168/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":140268617,"created_at":"2014/03/18 23:10:28 +0000","user_id":24097,"duration":2616851,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":104573304,"last_modified":"2014/09/15 11:26:07 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"BTK Optiv Podcast \"Dutty Audio\" 008","permalink":"daudiopodcast008","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Dutty Audio Podcast 008","description":"Dutty Audio Podcast 008\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.

Naturally, he’s stepped up. And he’s done so with two prize-fighting productions.\r\n\r\n‘Toys’ is a one-way ticket to the furthest boundaries of the cosmos. Warm pads purr while a frosty arpeggio twinkles and subtle guitar strums shimmer softly in the background. An ageless reminder of how delicate certain elements of D&B can be when conjured in the right hands, ‘Toys’ will instantly arrest your crowd’s imagination. Countering the dreaminess with raw bass drama, the beats and chubby subs ensure full weight and presence. Complete with a modest, memorable vocal refrain, it’s the perfect balance of elements.\r\n\r\n‘Creeper’ sets a much darker agenda: Opening with oceanic synth washes, an unrelenting breakbeat looms ominously in the mix. Firing hi-hats take the lead before we’re plunged into a cavernous drop where layers of irresistible bass envelop us. What follows is an industrial strength roller of junglist proportions.

Zero Tolerance\r\nOptiv & BTK | AA. Tapout\r\nRelease Date | 13/01/2014 \r\nVinyl & Digital\r\n\r\nAfter an incredible 2013, stacked with quality releases from a mass of great acts, we’re proud to present the first Dispatch Recordings release of 2014. Who better to bring in the New Year than Optiv & BTK? The duo return to the label for the first time since their debut with us back in 2011 (“Get Ready / Submission”) and they’ve been on a production warpath ever since! We’re proud to have them back at Dispatch with two unrelenting dancefloor killers.\r\n\r\nStarting off the single we have “Zero Tolerance”. This ferocious track is not to be taken lightly, it growls and progresses like a raging bull hurtling towards a matador. Receiving strong support from the likes of Andy C and Klute, it was also picked up by UKF for their YouTube channel on first listen. Prepare for damage.\r\n\r\n“Tapout” is the second track on the single, packing just as much venom as the first. Towering over the dance in true gladiatorial fashion, the gnarly bass chugs brutishly across any floor, whilst flashes of techy overtones run riot through the heart of the track. Sitting comfortably in all outcomes, whether it’s festival capacities or intimate club crowds, “Tapout” completes the release perfectly. Optiv & BTK do the business once again.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/djoptiv\r\ntwitter.com/optiv\r\n\r\nFor Bookings contact: tom@gramagency.co.uk\r\nNorth America: Scott@CyberGrooveProd.com","label_name":"Dispatch Recordings","release":"DIS075","track_type":"original","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2014,"release_month":1,"release_day":13,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128141090","user":{"id":14651,"kind":"user","permalink":"optiv","username":"Optiv","last_modified":"2016/07/30 05:14:14 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14651","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/optiv","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000204273668-ivn6wi-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/optiv/tapout","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000067179362-28h947-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/STHbYKyJegva_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128141090/stream","playback_count":20999,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":454,"comment_count":30,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/128141090/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":128302277,"created_at":"2014/01/07 09:38:22 +0000","user_id":15042,"duration":233399,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":9334073,"last_modified":"2016/05/29 18:54:43 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Hospital Phace Rawtekk","permalink":"rawtekk-photone-recruits-phace","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/rawtekkITUNES","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Rawtekk - Photone Recruits [Phace Remix] - Hospital Records","description":"PRE-ORDER VINYL/DIGITAL:\r\nbit.ly/rawtekk\r\nbit.ly/rawtekkITUNES\r\n\r\nFriend and fellow German, Phace, has stepped up with a rework of ‘Photone Recruits’ that is somehow even heavier and more brutal than it’s predecessor, receiving DJ support from S.P.Y, Ed Rush, Enei, June Miller, Foreign Concept and Radio 1 airplay from Rockwell and Friction.

Exceeding every possible expectation with their debut album ‘Future Perfect’ in May 2013, the duo won critical props and appreciation from every possible corner: from The Guardian to Mixmag, Hype to High Contrast, MTV to Radio 1… Love for Loadstar has been overwhelming. \r\n\r\nNaturally the love goes both ways.

Riddled with insane levels of energy and attitude, this is strictly peaktime business right here, confirming the duo’s current do-no-wrong status. \r\n\r\nRene LaVice is also on chop-slapping form with his incendiary rub. Processing the demonic dubsteppy intentions of the original into a rocket-powered stepper, it has the sound (and impact) of someone setting fire to entire firework factory and running off at full speed.

Ality adds oceanic sheet metal textures to the bass that’s neatly countered by tight weaves of dreamy synths while Abstr4ct takes the original’s distinctive paranoid riff and galvanises it with an iced out, steppy riddim and an array of system-blowing glitches. It’s so heavy Andy C included it on his recent ‘Nightlife 6’ mix. \r\n\r\nSix remixes, six reminders of Loadstar’s raw power.

A consummate contributor to the RAM legacy for over seven years, he’s executed countless precision appearances across the label’s extended network. And right now he’s about to make his debut on the ever-consistent, next-level focussed Program imprint.\r\n\r\n‘Trojan’ says it all. Even the title comes with heavyweight, dangerous connotations. Igniting with icy charm, Basher hurls us headfirst into an ocean of guttural bass and rolling concrete beats. Two low-end leads tightly twist and weave to create an enveloping sense of drama; savage distorted notes hammer his menacing message home while a creamy sub slopes and slithers beneath, tying up the elements to create the ultimate impact. Like the virus, ‘Trojan’ is instantly infectious; reprogramming your very understanding of groove mechanics.\r\n\r\nNext up, ‘Weep’. Collaborating with Frankee, ‘Weep’ is a soundclash of significant proportions. Long-term friends, Basher played a hugely influential role in Frankee’s career, inspiring him to explore the studio in the first place. From the second you press play it’s clear the two complement each other perfectly; measured, moody and mesmerising, ‘Weep’ creatively uses tightly clipped vocal shots as percussive and melodic devices that build dynamically before the waves of bass and pneumatic beats sweep you off your feet. Brutal yet bouncy, furious yet funky, ‘Weep’ is a matchless example of contemporary D&B production.\r\n\r\nTwo demonstrative damagers for the dark months ahead, Basher’s back on the attack and there’s no hiding from him. It’s time, once again, to get with the Program.

I trust them as much as I trust the wall mounted ATC's in our studios” - (Nik)\r\nNative Instruments Komplete 9 + Komplete Audio 6: “If i were stranded on a desert island with only one piece of music software it would have to be Komplete” - (Thijs)\r\nSoundcloud Pro Subscription: “This is a very pure platform for musicians. It's well made, and strikes a very nice balance between user friendliness and artist usability” - (Martijn)\r\n\r\nWe are officially ten years old. Officially, because 2003 was the year of our first release: 'Silicon' on Nerve Recordings. It was written at Nik's parents' house in Donderen, Drenthe. A small village in a rural area (population: 300). Not exactly the typical breeding ground for futuristic drum&bass... We didn't know anyone who was into what we were into, not in Donderen, not at our school (those three odd guys with their headphones on all day listening to that crazy fast computer music), not in Groningen as a whole, and even in Holland there were only a few people pushing that sound that we were after. At that time, vinyl sales had started to decline, and the 'golden era' of dark/ tech/ futuristic d&b (whatever you want to call it) seemed to be over, while we were singularly about that sound. Not the best time and place for us to start you could say.\r\n\r\nBut being an island of three friends making music wasn't so bad. As a matter of fact they were amazing years. It's strange to think that we were so focused, in between all the hanging out, smoking weed, playing games and catching jokes we actually took a serious life-changing path without fully realizing it. When we decided we needed management in 2006, we hired another friend from high school, Walter - who had no training, just like us. We're pretty sure he didn't fully realise what he would get himself into!\r\n\r\nAnd then there was the Internet. Through things like AOL Instant Messenger, the Dogs on Acid & Drum & Bass Arena forums (shouts to all the crew from back then!) we found a way to connect to a scene that was only beginning to discover the possibilities - and consequences - of being online. This internet world is how we got our music out there. It seems dead obvious now, but it really wasn't back then. We got our first exposure through a website called 'electronicscene.com': our track 'Drifter' was even featured on the homepage. Think Soundcloud but ten years ago (the domain name has since changed but there's still a demo up there from 2002... It's quite embarassing but here you go: artistserver.com/noisia). Anyway one thing led to another, we met dj Mayhem online, he signed us to Shadow-Law Recordings, helped us on our path, introduced us to people, we signed 'Silicon' to Paul Reset's Nerve Recordings, and then came our first real DJ gig abroad in Budapest in January 2004…\r\n\r\nAnd now we are here - ten years of releases under our belt and a million followers on Soundcloud. Over the years we have met many incredible musicians, labels, deejays and industry people that we consider our friends and that have inspired us, helped us and taught us things. But in a way, we are still that island. Our crew has just grown, but we're still out in Groningen, with our own studios, our own management, our own music on our own labels, trying to do things in a way we think is good.\r\n\r\nHaving said all this retrospective old man shit, it's important to also mention that we don't feel 'arrived' or 'settled' in any way. It feels like we have only just begun. We're aching to write new music (new Noisia album dammit!). From windy and rainy Groningen: Thank you all for your amazing and enduring support over these last ten years.

Truly monumental.","label_name":"Renegade Hardware","release":"HWARE27","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2013,"release_month":10,"release_day":28,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116253262","user":{"id":27942,"kind":"user","permalink":"renegade-hardware","username":"Renegade Hardware","last_modified":"2016/04/29 11:50:36 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/27942","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/renegade-hardware","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000044414884-bsoias-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/renegade-hardware/cern-feat-subtension-organism","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000060612088-vbdrru-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/J7QGyt61b8VH_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116253262/stream","playback_count":13965,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":519,"comment_count":40,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/116253262/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":61474753,"created_at":"2012/09/28 12:38:12 +0000","user_id":19841014,"duration":3581173,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":144089510,"last_modified":"2015/07/22 06:02:09 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Myselor \"Future Funk Music\" Podcast \"Mindtech Recordings\" Neurofunk","permalink":"funk-to-the-podcast-001","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":"http://futurefunkmusic.bandcamp.com/merch/ffmts001-2","label_id":19841014,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Neurofunk","title":"Funk To The Podcast 001 - Mixed by Myselor","description":"01 - Fearful &amp; Keosz - Obedience (Future Funk Music)&#13;\n02 - State of Mind - Spastic Audio (M-ATOME)&#13;\n03 - Distant Future - Eternal Chance (Future Funk Music)&#13;\n04 - Octane and DLR - Back In The Grind (Cern and Dabs remix) (Dispatch Recs)&#13;\n05 - Larrge - Sequence (Future Funk Music)&#13;\n06 - Dioptrics - Code of Honor (Mindtech dub)&#13;\n07 - Scinetyc - Sayonara Sukosi Iki  (CITRUS)&#13;\n08 - Insom - Mint Engraver (Fututre Funk Music)&#13;\n09 - Larrge - Antidott  (Future Funk Music)&#13;\n10 - Disphonia - Collapsed (ZERO_METHOD_remix) (Citrus)&#13;\n11 - Myselor - The Last Melody (Future Funk Music)&#13;\n12 - DBR UK &amp; Displaced Paranormals - NZT48 (Cyclone)&#13;\n13 - Distant Future - Synthesis (Future Funk Music)&#13;\n14 - Future Signal and Semantics - Wrong Turn (Mindtech dub)&#13;\n15 - Mob Tactics - Prang (Dutty Audio)&#13;\n16 - No Remorse &amp; DV2R - Mesh (Ammunition)&#13;\n17 - Semantics - Silo (Mindtech dub)&#13;\n18 - Myselor - To Chase (Mindtech dub)&#13;\n19 - Blah - Face To Face (Mindtech dub) &#13;\n20 - Semantics - Too Close (Mindtech dub)&#13;\n21 - Octane and DLR - Murmur (ft break) (Dispatch Recs)&#13;\n22 - Dephzac feat.

The track’s strength lies in the way it builds, adding texture and substance, with the intro morphing itself into an insistent, pulsing tune where new features are found around corners as the main part of the track hurtles by. Rhythmically complex, there are many strands to this one, and Dose fully goes in on the production. Exciting, dynamic, and destined to be huge.","label_name":"Anodyne Audio","release":"ANODYNE005","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2013,"release_month":9,"release_day":30,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/108975659","user":{"id":13325915,"kind":"user","permalink":"anodyne-audio","username":"Anodyne Audio","last_modified":"2016/02/18 14:21:02 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/13325915","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/anodyne-audio","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000011543570-ted0lv-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/anodyne-audio/dose-nicotine-dream-anodyne005","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000057051482-60h17i-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/vOu2yYbvLRXp_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/108975659/stream","playback_count":2521,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":77,"comment_count":8,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/108975659/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":108975926,"created_at":"2013/09/05 15:51:42 +0000","user_id":13325915,"duration":90130,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":2163463,"last_modified":"2015/12/20 12:20:39 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Dose Stamina \"Nicotine Dream\" \"Anodyne Audio\" ANODYNE005 \"Drum & Bass\"","permalink":"dose-stamina-clip-anodyne005","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/track/stamina-original-mix/4670329","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Dose - Stamina - clip (ANODYNE005) - OUT NOW","description":"Stamina is one amazing piece of music, right from the intro until the very last beats. Things begin calmly enough, before the drums and bass kick off in tandem. The earth will shake, your sets will vibrate, and your brains will explode once this one gets going. Prepare yourself for impact as a marauding bassline sets its course straight for you, as effects and vocal snatches compliment. Straight up, front and centre drum & bass that makes no pretentions and takes no prisoners.

Futuristic, funky and furious, this one'll have you itching to bust a move.\r\n￼\r\nThis latest single readily demonstrates two producers at the top of their game right now.

Naturally, this is a massive release that’s sure to blow up dancefloors worldwide! \r\n\r\nFrankee Black Heart / Wonderland\r\n\r\n‘Black Heart’ lives up to its name in every single sense. We’d say ‘it does what it says on the tin’ but there is no tin, just an incredible sense of foreboding ghostly doom. Darkness soars through each eastern wail while the rich bassline drives deep into the groove, doubling up towards the builds for extra drama. Peppered with nuances of neuro funk, once again Frankee has shown an understanding of drum & bass dynamics that belies his young years. \r\n\r\nFor the ultimate switch-flipper, head to ‘Wonderland’. The complete contrast to ‘Black Heart’, here we find the London producer paying the ultimate homage to drum & bass jungle’s earliest rave carnations. With vibrant, euphoric piano licks, skippy breakbeats and subs so heavy they need their own passport, ‘Wonderland’ is a quintessential example of contemporary rave. As for the emphatic vocal? We can all agree with its sentiments. Music is indeed wonderful – especially when it’s being written by the likes of Frankee.

Going in for the kill with his Program debut, the London-based artist has made his move with precision instinct, leaping on us with two rich, rampant rollers just when we least expect it. \r\n\r\nInherently underground and immaculately timeless, both ‘Scrummage’ and ‘Nanite’ purr with intricate production prowess. Late night vibes for drum & bass connoisseurs, they carry the hallmarks longevity, offering something new on every listen. \r\n\r\n‘Scrummage’ leads. Opening with crisp, cold atmospheric subtleties, a waspish bassline zips its way into the mix by way of crafty LFO. Fluctuating with angular attitude, the bassline soon becomes the main melody, pinging us back and forth with gritty cheekiness. As we roll deeper into the mix, we’re introduced to haunted one-shot human elements and a wealth of sub bass that underpins the whole composition. Vicious without the shoutiness; like the genuine tough guys who never even have to raise their voice, ‘Scrummage’ is 100 per cent killer. \r\n\r\nThe icy vibe continues on ‘Nanite’. Sharp, stark and steppy, this one’s home to yet more creamy sub bass and pensive, synapse-snapping kicks, conjuring up memories of the mid-to-late 90s when drum & bass was really finding its own identity. Boasting a truly menacing vocal sample, the track title might have connotations of a sweet night’s sleep but the overall message is clear: don’t have nightmares. \r\n\r\nTwo killer workouts, one unmissable label debut. Once again, it’s time to get with the Program!

Overdrive #SchemaEP","description":"Hamilton - Schema EP - OUT NOW - http://po.st/SchemaEP\r\n\r\niTunes - http://po.st/SchemaEP\r\nRAM Shop - http://po.st/SchemaRS\r\nBeatport - http://po.st/SchemaBP\r\nTrackitdown - http://po.st/SchemaTID\r\n\r\nHamilton - Schema EP Last seen on Ram tearing up the dance with the mighty ‘Deep In My Heart’ and ‘Rich Kids’, Hamilton has been in studio lockdown working on a whole series of next-level workouts that will be rolling out this June and July. Presented in a unique three-vinyl release schedule with a massive digital package climax, this is, without doubt, Hamilton’s biggest delivery to date. \r\n\r\n‘Push’ is the ultimate motivational message. The perfect way to start this epic series of slammers; Hamilton nods at his authentic rave heritage with rushy, synth blasts and a sexy breathy vocal while an enormous metallic bassline worms and wriggles beneath. You’ll be hard pushed to find a finer balance of laser-gazing and screw-facing this season… \r\n\r\nLike to get sweary and lairy? Head straight to ‘F**k It Up’. A ruthless bassline monster, it oozes sub trouble as the clipped lead bass tones stalk the sharp two-step with true menace. With a rabble-rousing vocal sample on the fills and builds, ‘F**k It Up’ isn’t a suggestion… It’s a guarantee. \r\n\r\n‘Get Together’ is another fine example of Hamilton’s aspirational audio; broadcasting one clear message of unity it’s a sonic kaleidoscope of striding stabs, twinkling arpeggios, euphoric dynamics and an emphatic vocal message. Vibrant andunashamedly positive but laced with plenty of low-end naughtiness, it’s the ultimate huggathon anthem.      \r\n\r\n‘Overdrive’ follows. Igniting with instant percussive drama and palpitating haunted synths, we’re soon thrown deep into the sub pit as a slinky-but-savage bassline sears back and forth, answering questions you didn’t even ask. Rolling with a slight twang of techno sensibility, the rises and processed bass glitches give it the ultimate ‘heads down’ feel. In a word: heavy! \r\n\r\nUp next, the turbo-charged ‘Way I Feel’. A stimulating attack of the senses; Hamilton toys with our emotions as he smoothly rolls out a beautiful soul-massaging synth and vocal soaked intro before setting fire to it with an absolute sizzler of a bassline. Spine-tingles all round, this not only showcases Hamilton’s production power, but reminds us of the raw, carnal energy that’s unique to drum & bass. \r\n\r\n‘Brainstorm VIP’ is exactly what you imagine it to be… A rebooted, bareback ride on Hamilton’s breakthrough 2011 smasher. Adding more emphasis on the bass texture and overall weight to an already massive track, if you think the original slammed the dance, this one smashes it. Then destroys it. Then totally murders it. It’s what the term VIP was invented for. \r\n\r\nFlipping the switch: ‘Your Love’ sees Hamilton laying down the slow n’ smoochy vibes for a textbook end-of-night tear-jerker… Strutting on a tight halfstep with weighty kicks, be prepared for a startling array of lead psychedelic bass twirls and low-end melodic motifs. Emotional enough to get the baddest of badmen weak at the knees, it’s D&B at its most romantic. \r\n\r\nAnd so we reach the grand finale. And what a finale! ‘You Had It’ tips an affectionate nod to the old skool with blow-out vocal hit that will have you racking your brains when you last heard it. Rising and rising with insistent keys, sweeping synths and yet another trademark Hamilton hellraiser bassline, it’s the perfect way to end Hamilton’s biggest release to date.","label_name":"RAM","release":"RAMM136","track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2013,"release_month":7,"release_day":7,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/100151211","user":{"id":434854,"kind":"user","permalink":"ramrecords","username":"RAM Records","last_modified":"2016/05/18 09:21:53 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/434854","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000182048273-qa289q-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords/hamilton-overdrive-schemaep","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000052431030-tn5nx7-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/uZ2YWg7xAbBC_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/100151211/stream","playback_count":10294,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":217,"comment_count":14,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/100151211/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":99697387,"created_at":"2013/07/04 19:27:49 +0000","user_id":43418,"duration":3585510,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":143486011,"last_modified":"2016/01/23 17:25:04 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Mindtech MindtechLTD Myselor Insom Dioptrics \"Teddy Killerz\" \"Chris Su\" Mindscape Break Rregula \"Zero Method\" L33 \"Mob Tactics\" Symplex \"Dub Head\" Network Disphonia Kantyze Axi \"Black Sun Empire\" Noisia Dose Billain \"Future Funk Music\" Podcast Neurofunk","permalink":"podcast-019-mixed-by-myselor","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":"http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/mindtech-recordings-podcast/id383018855","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Subscribe with iTunes","genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Mindtech Podcast - 019 mixed by Myselor","description":"Introducing his brand new cd album 'Parallel Consciousness' LP&#13;\n<b>Myselor</b> is back on Mindtech, bringing you a fresh mix for the summer!&#13;\n&#13;\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Myselor/435728949797642\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">facebook.com/Myselor</a>&#13;\n<a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/myselor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">soundcloud.com/Myselor</a>&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\nTrack List:&#13;\n&#13;\n01.

Original tracks by Usual Suspects, Optiv & BTK, Maztek and Future Cut are re-imagined by InsideInfo, Maztek, Optiv & BTK and Verb respectively.\r\n\r\nThe InsideInfo remix of Usual Suspects’ Killa Bees leads things off, with its recognisable apocalyptic opening and signature vocal sample. As the beat drops in, the world as you know it will stop, replaced by a pulsing, addictive soundscape. InsideInfo adds his usual rolling, headnodding beats, and squelching, claustrophobic basslines. You’ll be surrounded by Killer Bees, and won’t be able to get away.\r\n\r\nThree of the best get together on the next two cuts, with Maztek remixing Inception by Optiv and BTK and the British/Brazilian combo returning the favour on the Italian’s Limber. On the former, things get dark and deadly early on, with a sci-fi feel mixed with classic RH vibes. The sound is of a dystopian future, controlled by the machine overlords, as booming bass teams up with sliding live-effect drums. On the Optiv and BTK remix of Limber, the duo have opened up the track, letting the inner workings breathe more, by which method the soul and the funk of the original is emphasised. After a towering opening, the raw guts of the track spill onto the sidewalk, as visceral and unforgiving as anything you’ll hear all year. Get caught in the web that is Limber.\r\n\r\nClosing things off we have Verb going in on the classic Whiplash by Future Cut. The samples are all still there, but this time surrounded by some tunnel-like synths before the drop. When things do close in, we are treated to a hail of amens, lifted by the sheer rush of the drums, and some steadily-handled bass runs.\r\n\r\nGrab the Reanimation EP, and be part of it.\r\n\r\nReleased: 15th July 2013\r\nFormats: 2x12\" Vinyl / Digital\r\n\r\nPre Order Here:\r\nRH Store: tiny.cc/buy_hware25\r\niTunes: smarturl.it/ReanimationEP\r\n\r\nFull Tracklist: \r\n1.

Seriously amazing.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\nFor Bookings contact: tom@gramagency.co.uk\r\nNorth America: Scott@CyberGrooveProd.com\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/djoptiv\r\ntwitter.com/optiv","label_name":"Cause4Concern Recordings","release":"C4CDIGUK019","track_type":"original","key_signature":"","isrc":"GB-YJW-13-00113","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2013,"release_month":5,"release_day":27,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90053078","user":{"id":14651,"kind":"user","permalink":"optiv","username":"Optiv","last_modified":"2016/07/30 05:14:14 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14651","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/optiv","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000204273668-ivn6wi-large.jpg"},"label":{"id":37865,"kind":"user","permalink":"cause4concern-recordings","username":"Cause4Concern Recordings","last_modified":"2016/07/27 12:04:16 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/37865","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/cause4concern-recordings","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000209678494-f6ydth-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/optiv/optiv-cza-journey-inwards-c4c","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000046801770-445oa7-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/wEBxDvP4wcFG_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90053078/stream","playback_count":24100,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":437,"comment_count":60,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90053078/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":90126292,"created_at":"2013/04/30 09:54:35 +0000","user_id":43418,"duration":122890,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4914225,"last_modified":"2014/10/16 17:30:05 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"axi-skyscraper","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/mind-technologies-vol-3/1083989","label_id":43418,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Axi - Skyscraper","description":" Mind Technologies Vol 3 - http://bit.ly/mtrdlp007","label_name":"Mindtech Recordings","release":"MTRDLP07","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90126292","user":{"id":43418,"kind":"user","permalink":"mindtech-recordings","username":"Mindtech Recordings","last_modified":"2016/08/01 13:20:06 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/43418","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/mindtech-recordings","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000243385498-wcwmk9-large.jpg"},"label":{"id":43418,"kind":"user","permalink":"mindtech-recordings","username":"Mindtech Recordings","last_modified":"2016/08/01 13:20:06 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/43418","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/mindtech-recordings","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000243385498-wcwmk9-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/mindtech-recordings/axi-skyscraper","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000046842935-jif603-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/vXZpaAAuw8uP_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90126292/stream","playback_count":2335,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":81,"comment_count":13,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/90126292/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":91030936,"created_at":"2013/05/06 20:14:21 +0000","user_id":14651,"duration":98987,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":2375996,"last_modified":"2015/08/12 22:33:41 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"Optiv CZA \"Optiv & CZA\" \"Journey Inwards\" \"I Feel\" \"C4C Recordings\" Cause4Concern C4C C4CDIGUK019","permalink":"optiv-cza-i-feel-c4c","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/journey-inwards-ep/1091938","label_id":37865,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Optiv & CZA - I Feel - C4C Recordings - OUT NOW!!","description":"Feel your way through I Feel, with its alluring intro, cascading drum line and dirty, tearing b-line.

Like we did with the Energy EP \r\nseries released in 2011, each vinyl single will be limited to 500 copies only; a true collector’s item so to speak!

Opening with a series of infectious clicks and whirrs, his engine purrs with a pensive funk that isn’t realised fully until the delicious vocal and bassline bounce kick in. The epitome of a contemporary roller, this stripped back groove attack has been a highlight of Andy C’s sets for the past few months, causing major commotions amongst both the raving crew and fellow DJs whenever he drops it.\r\n\r\nAudio & Meth follow. And they do so with an almighty switch-flip. Hot on the heels of their monstrous ‘Gamma’ on Audio’s latest album ‘Soul Magnet’, the duo continue to strut their heavyweight co-lab stuff with ‘Alone’. Drenched in drama and grizzling bass tears, ‘Alone’ opens with a cavalcade of haunting horns before dropping into an all-out filth workout. Spitting snub-nosed sonics, it’s like the late 90s all over again… But with production skills our last-century D&B forefathers could only dream of.\r\n\r\nUp next: Eastcolors who’s served up a track that’s in grave danger of literally living up to its title. ‘Murderer’ harbours a bassline so deadly it could bump your dancefloor to death with its endless mutations and manipulations. Sprung with a fine-tuned funk and arranged with dynamite dynamics, this is one murder case all dancefloor detectives want to solve.\r\n\r\nIt’s down to Paul B to bring this speaker-smashing set to a fitting conclusion. A dab-hand at this D&B game since the turn of the century, ‘Drop By Drop’ shows just why the Russian artist is widely regarded as ‘the producer’s producer’.

chaingang","description":"Release Date November 15th 2010:\n\nFor those who don't know their D&amp;B history, Black Sun Empire were one of the first acts to break through the barrier put up by UK artists surrounding the genre. Ever since the days of jungle, drum &amp; bass had been considered British property and woe betide any producer from outside who dared to try and muscle in.\n\nHowever, with determination and an undeniable weight of talent behind them, the Utrecht-based threesome broke through the ranks. Initially getting picked up by DJ Trace for his infamous DSCi4 imprint at the turn of the millennium it wasn't long before Black Sun Empire were rubbing shoulders with the scene's elite who lapped up their uncompromising, techno-influenced sound.\n\nThese days of course it's all very normal to have artists from all corners of the globe representing whatever genre they feel like. And anyone who's got a keen eye for detail will have already noticed that Black Sun Empire have travelled a decade's worth of their drum &amp; bass journey, with three incredible studio albums under their belt already.\n\nThose with an even keener eye will know that it's been three years since the release of 'Endangered Species', the last Black Sun Empire album. In that time the trio enlisted Telemetrik to drop an amazing LP (D&amp;B Album of the Month, Mixmag) on their own label while they took some time to flex their musical muscles in the build up to their latest project, 'Lights And Wires'.\n\nEncompassing that unmistakable BSE sound throughout, 'Lights And Wires' is an accomplished piece of work that simultaneously brings together ten years of drum &amp; bass production while exploring new musical ground. Tracks like 'Extraction' and 'Kempi' (ft. Nymfo) are vintage Black Sun Empire. Rough, rugged and raw, fans of intense D&amp;B will not be disappointed. But it's the experiments into other tempos that display a maturity that only gifted artists can achieve.\n\n'The 405' is an intense journey into a techno-edged dubstep nightmare, a horror movie at 140bpm that is both new ground, yet entirely Black Sun Empire. 'Dirty Friday' juxtaposes wide-open synths with cavernous bass to devastating effect, while tracks like 'Black River Bay' slide effortlessly into blissed-out electronica.\n\n'Lights And Wires' will satisfy any fan of Black Sun Empire's previous work, while opening up a path to new sounds and moods without compromising anything along the way. This is without doubt an album packed with integrity.\n\nJeryl Wilton\nInfectious PR","label_name":"black sun empire ","release":"bselp005","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2010,"release_month":11,"release_day":15,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/6040476","user":{"id":30296,"kind":"user","permalink":"blacksunempire","username":"Black Sun Empire","last_modified":"2016/08/15 05:06:13 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/30296","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/blacksunempire","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000153644672-bzxd92-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/blacksunempire/bselp005ep-a-bse-chaingang","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000002612808-op49rl-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/VaqI4vdb3PkM_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/6040476/stream","playback_count":9700,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":62,"comment_count":16,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/6040476/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":49065950,"created_at":"2012/06/08 18:31:52 +0000","user_id":43418,"duration":109860,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4543427,"last_modified":"2015/11/29 21:27:33 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"nphonix-nickbee-ego-death-mindtech002a-preview","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.chemical-records.co.uk/sc/servlet/Info?Track=MINDTECH002","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Buy the 12\" vinyl","genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Nphonix & NickBee - Ego Death","description":"Ukrainian Nickbee, young protégé of Sunchase, has teamed up with Moscovite Nphonix on Ego Death which, for us, will be one of the neuro anthems of the year!

Well Terror Snake and Downie Wolf, otherwise known as The Upbeats, fit that mould perfectly. With an unrelenting passion for drum & bass and an ever fresh take on the genre this New Zealand based duo has risen to the top of the scene, releasing tracks on the most respected labels in the game. \r\n\r\nThis year the pair have already remixed Noisia’s dance floor anthem ‘Diplodocus’ for deadmau5’s mau5trap label and teamed up with the Dutch trio for the incredible ‘Dustup’. Now The Upbeats are celebrating signing to Noisia’s Vision label with a giveaway of ‘Undertaker’ - a huge drum & bass track packed with their trademark energy.

The result is a diverse collection inspired by the entire spectrum of drum ‘n bass. From furious techstep to more laidback grooves, each track bears the signature of its creator for the ultimate international showcase.\r\n\r\nDespite the eclectic mix of personalities, the Sinuous LP stays true to the label’s central ideas. Dark, reverberating bass-lines are accompanied by sparse and melodic textures in order to elicit a range of emotions in the listener.\r\n\r\nTen years in the making, The Sinuous LP is a massive ‘thank you’ for all the support and love we’ve received since our humble beginnings a decade ago. So prepare yourself for drum ‘n bass at it most raw and undiluted…a complete distillation of the Sinuous Records philosophy on one fantastic album.\r\n\r\nAvailable from the 3rd December limited \r\n12\" vinyl 14 track Cd / digipak .Sinuous LP\r\n\r\n12\" vinyl limited \r\nMaztek - Crawler \r\nMasheen -Connection\r\n\r\n14 track Cd / digipak\r\n\r\nMaztek - Crawler \r\nMasheen -Connection \r\nAllied - Catalysis \r\nFragz - Second Intentions \r\nPlace 2B - Red ( remix Place 2B & Paimon ) \r\nL 33 - Transient \r\nSubtension - Hangar \r\nBorderline - The Wanted \r\nFlame - Chain Interlock \r\nCooper - The Chosen One \r\nScinetyc - Unbound Soul \r\nDisplaced Paranormals - Abstract \r\nDiagram -Simulacrum \r\nFuture Signal -Realm\r\n\r\nPlease follow the links below to select the format that is appropriate for you. \r\nhttp://www.triplevision.nl/release/SINLP001CD/","label_name":"sinuous001","release":"","track_type":"podcast","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2012,"release_month":12,"release_day":3,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/70336886","user":{"id":51145,"kind":"user","permalink":"maztek","username":"Maztek","last_modified":"2016/08/08 13:46:18 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/51145","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/maztek","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000215959830-9mfhjj-large.jpg"},"label":{"id":14438647,"kind":"user","permalink":"sinuous001","username":"sinuous001","last_modified":"2012/07/26 16:09:07 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14438647","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/sinuous001","avatar_url":"https://a1.sndcdn.com/images/default_avatar_large.png"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/maztek/sinuous-records-exclusive","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000035700286-4sg9vu-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/cE7lWjKzpbGw_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/70336886/stream","download_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/70336886/download","playback_count":3527,"download_count":499,"favoritings_count":134,"comment_count":29,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/70336886/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":68885159,"created_at":"2012/11/26 11:14:41 +0000","user_id":2218860,"duration":110455,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":2651222,"last_modified":"2015/04/29 12:39:38 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"mindscape-stardust","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://bit.ly/So99xN","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Mindscape 'Stardust' // 12\", CD & Digital // Out Now!","description":"Released 03.12 on 12\" vinyl, get yours here - http://bit.ly/So99xN\r\n\r\nWelcome to the 2 track sampler for the 2nd full length LP from Mindscape on your fave label Commercial Suicide.

An integral part of the Bristol bass music scene LoKo has had his tracks remixed by KOAN Sound, co-founded and subsequently released intense remixes and original tracks on Screwloose Records and now gained Andy C’s approval as he joins the ranks of our new label, Program.\r\n \r\nJust one listen to ‘Bassline Secret’ and you’ll understand why Andy C has thrown his weight behind it. At once a grinding slice of modern drum & bass with a heavy nod to the nostalgic days of the Prototype Years, this is an undeniably fresh take on a classic sound. Skipping breakbeats and grinding bassline combinations sit effortlessly in the mix with each sound playing its part without overpowering the others. Here LoKo has achieved a fine balance that will make ‘Bassline Secret’ stand out from the crowd - in the club, on your iPod or blasting out of your car as you zoom down the motorway to your next D&B night!\r\n\r\nFlip over and ‘Shadows’ showcases LoKo’s production talent once again with a massive call-and-response bassline hook. Yet again the Bristol-based producer displays his ability to update a classic drum & bass sound with some modern studio techniques and some fresh ideas by subtly manipulating and progressing the interplay of the bass sounds throughout the tune.

Beardyman","description":"‘All Or Nothing’ is the long-awaited follow up to Calyx & TeeBee’s debut album ‘Anatomy’ set to be released on one of the bass music scene’s longest running and most highly respected labels, Ram Records. The duo’s first single from their new album has already been supported by Zane Lowe, Annie Mac, Trevor Nelson and many more of the world’s leading tastemakers, and ‘All Or Nothing’ looks set to catapult this incredible production partnership to all new heights. \r\n\r\nCalyx & TeeBee’s debut album ‘Anatomy’, released in 2007 on their own label was an instant game changer; cited as a landmark album for the scene ‘Anatomy’ saw the duo unleash an almighty wall of sound that rocked dance floors across the globe as they took to the road with their 6 deck DJ sets, smashing apart sound systems in nightclubs and festival tents alike.  \r\n\r\nNow, five years later, hordes of fans are aching for a new Calyx & TeeBee album and the duo are definitely not going to disappoint. Signing to Ram Records, Calyx & TeeBee have produced a long player that sounds fresh, current and forward-thinking. ‘All Or Nothing’ is their sophomore offering and is packed with new ideas, exciting collaborations, stunning musicality and an incredible level of technical skill. \r\n\r\nFrom the epic opening gambit, ‘Heroes & Villains’, it’s clear that Calyx & TeeBee have created something special with their new album. The D&B jazz fusion of ‘Pure Gold’ ft. Kemo contrasts beautifully with the vocal-led minimalism of ‘Strung Out’ and the hip hop excellence of ‘We Become One’, a collaboration with Foreign Beggars and DJ Craze. Then Calyx & TeeBee hit you with the rock-influenced ‘You’ll Never Take Me Alive’ featuring Beardyman, providing yet another inspired piece of deliciously different drum & bass. Each track on ‘All Or Nothing’ is crafted with expert precision and infused with a fresh and unique set of influences.\r\n\r\nBut while ‘All Or Nothing’ is packed with stand-out moments, it’s the album as a whole that becomes something far more exciting than the sum of its parts. Calyx & TeeBee stitch each moment together with over a decade’s worth of knowledge and an undeniable wisdom about how to create an exciting and unique sounding album. ‘All Or Nothing’ will draw you in and refuse to let go as moods and ideas flow freely, leaving you gasping for breath. This will undoubtedly be one of the albums of the year, if not the decade.\r\n","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64763899","user":{"id":434854,"kind":"user","permalink":"ramrecords","username":"RAM Records","last_modified":"2016/05/18 09:21:53 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/434854","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000182048273-qa289q-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords/calyx-teebee-youll-never-take","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000031474638-bncmz9-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/7OiGWrHvHHaU_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64763899/stream","playback_count":27954,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":668,"comment_count":56,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64763899/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":61803220,"created_at":"2012/10/01 11:48:45 +0000","user_id":434854,"duration":104969,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4197483,"last_modified":"2013/12/14 04:03:59 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"rene-lavice-all-my-trials-ft","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Rene LaVIce - All My Trials ft Ivy Mairi","description":"Earlier in the year Rene LaVice’s ‘Absolute Monster’ EP blew everyone away with its melting pot of different influences and styles, all blended together with Rene’s undeniable sense of experimentation.

This track lives in a world where euphoric drum & bass doesn’t have to mean throwaway riffs and quickly forgotten formulas. Rather Rene brings beautiful music to the foreground, infusing Ivy’s luscious vocals and heart-tugging strings with classic elements of drum & bass, offering a timeless snapshot of feel good fast soul music for the modern dance floor. This tune will unquestionably become the soundtrack to some of the best nights out you’ll have this autumn. \r\n\r\n‘Not Deep’ takes another turn for the experimental as Rene throws out the rulebook, blending genuinely different melodies with unique male vocals and a deluge of ideas that all somehow come together in perfect harmony.

Packed with fresh ideas and sounds, Rene’s latest Ram Records release is undoubtedly unique, but without losing itself in a sea of pomposity.

We Fall Away","description":"‘All Or Nothing’ is the long-awaited follow up to Calyx & TeeBee’s debut album ‘Anatomy’ set to be released on one of the bass music scene’s longest running and most highly respected labels, Ram Records. The duo’s first single from their new album has already been supported by Zane Lowe, Annie Mac, Trevor Nelson and many more of the world’s leading tastemakers, and ‘All Or Nothing’ looks set to catapult this incredible production partnership to all new heights. \r\n\r\nCalyx & TeeBee’s debut album ‘Anatomy’, released in 2007 on their own label was an instant game changer; cited as a landmark album for the scene ‘Anatomy’ saw the duo unleash an almighty wall of sound that rocked dance floors across the globe as they took to the road with their 6 deck DJ sets, smashing apart sound systems in nightclubs and festival tents alike.  \r\n\r\nNow, five years later, hordes of fans are aching for a new Calyx & TeeBee album and the duo are definitely not going to disappoint. Signing to Ram Records, Calyx & TeeBee have produced a long player that sounds fresh, current and forward-thinking. ‘All Or Nothing’ is their sophomore offering and is packed with new ideas, exciting collaborations, stunning musicality and an incredible level of technical skill. \r\n\r\nFrom the epic opening gambit, ‘Heroes & Villains’, it’s clear that Calyx & TeeBee have created something special with their new album. The D&B jazz fusion of ‘Pure Gold’ ft. Kemo contrasts beautifully with the vocal-led minimalism of ‘Strung Out’ and the hip hop excellence of ‘We Become One’, a collaboration with Foreign Beggars and DJ Craze. Then Calyx & TeeBee hit you with the rock-influenced ‘You’ll Never Take Me Alive’ featuring Beardyman, providing yet another inspired piece of deliciously different drum & bass. Each track on ‘All Or Nothing’ is crafted with expert precision and infused with a fresh and unique set of influences.\r\n\r\nBut while ‘All Or Nothing’ is packed with stand-out moments, it’s the album as a whole that becomes something far more exciting than the sum of its parts. Calyx & TeeBee stitch each moment together with over a decade’s worth of knowledge and an undeniable wisdom about how to create an exciting and unique sounding album. ‘All Or Nothing’ will draw you in and refuse to let go as moods and ideas flow freely, leaving you gasping for breath. This will undoubtedly be one of the albums of the year, if not the decade.\r\n","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62061942","user":{"id":434854,"kind":"user","permalink":"ramrecords","username":"RAM Records","last_modified":"2016/05/18 09:21:53 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/434854","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000182048273-qa289q-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords/calyx-teebee-we-fall-away","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000031474638-bncmz9-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/LoQnBDlTZAKx_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62061942/stream","playback_count":45143,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1085,"comment_count":110,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62061942/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":62061941,"created_at":"2012/10/03 13:42:00 +0000","user_id":434854,"duration":100215,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4007311,"last_modified":"2016/05/13 07:55:52 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"","permalink":"calyx-teebee-heroes-villains","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"Calyx & TeeBee - Heroes & Villains","description":"‘All Or Nothing’ is the long-awaited follow up to Calyx & TeeBee’s debut album ‘Anatomy’ set to be released on one of the bass music scene’s longest running and most highly respected labels, Ram Records.

Calyx & TeeBee stitch each moment together with over a decade’s worth of knowledge and an undeniable wisdom about how to create an exciting and unique sounding album. ‘All Or Nothing’ will draw you in and refuse to let go as moods and ideas flow freely, leaving you gasping for breath. This will undoubtedly be one of the albums of the year, if not the decade.\r\n","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62061941","user":{"id":434854,"kind":"user","permalink":"ramrecords","username":"RAM Records","last_modified":"2016/05/18 09:21:53 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/434854","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000182048273-qa289q-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords/calyx-teebee-heroes-villains","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000031474638-bncmz9-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/pnUPxMC9qMck_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62061941/stream","playback_count":65068,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":1171,"comment_count":115,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62061941/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":45585043,"created_at":"2012/05/07 13:02:42 +0000","user_id":14736704,"duration":139572,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":2231484,"last_modified":"2015/12/15 23:29:28 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"drum&bass distant_future techstep newschool","permalink":"distant-future-disposal","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"drum and bass","title":"Distant Future - Disposal (Piranha Pool)","description":"","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"demo","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/45585043","user":{"id":14736704,"kind":"user","permalink":"distant-future-1","username":"distant future","last_modified":"2016/05/04 08:44:17 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14736704","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/distant-future-1","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000160991634-c833dc-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/distant-future-1/distant-future-disposal","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000031475328-ri5u10-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/hBb4tEZsUKlY_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/45585043/stream","playback_count":2535,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":90,"comment_count":25,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/45585043/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":62062425,"created_at":"2012/10/03 13:47:59 +0000","user_id":14736704,"duration":146220,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":2338900,"last_modified":"2015/08/11 11:29:59 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"techstep nuschool drumandbass dnb","permalink":"distant-future-disorder","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"distantfuture","title":"Distant Future - Disorder [Sinuous Records]","description":"","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"demo","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62062425","user":{"id":14736704,"kind":"user","permalink":"distant-future-1","username":"distant future","last_modified":"2016/05/04 08:44:17 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/14736704","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/distant-future-1","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000160991634-c833dc-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/distant-future-1/distant-future-disorder","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000126015229-7dlhw2-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/g1ykSPfaaNgQ_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62062425/stream","playback_count":1680,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":70,"comment_count":17,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/62062425/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":11745914,"created_at":"2011/03/10 10:30:12 +0000","user_id":629332,"duration":156453,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":6257811,"last_modified":"2015/09/20 11:00:20 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"EBK Octane Mainframe Renegade Hardware Dub Inception EP Drum Bass New Cock Face Gusto dispatch critical dlr","permalink":"ebk-octane-dlr-feat-gusto","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":27942,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & Bass","title":"EBK, Octane & DLR feat.

A producer who has steadily been building a dedicated following over the last few years with his consistently solid releases and clinically crisp production style. He goes by the name of Maztek, and we present you with his highly anticipated debut single on Hardware.\r\n\r\n'Galactia' provides the first voyage into Maztek's sound. An upbeat, driving slice of pure future funk. Lively rock solid drums and a grinding push/pull bassline that drives straight through the floor. The launch sequence has been initiated!\r\n\r\nBut yet the journey has merely begun. With a continuation of the space age theme, the 2nd track Odessey is just that; an epic soundscape voyage into Maztek's world. Lead by a destructively deep bass line that weaves through the arrangement and travels star bound. Uplifted by warm, drifting pads and shimmering fx.\r\n\r\nThe single provides a showcase of styles that set's the standard for whats to follow from this exciting producer, and this is just the beginning….","label_name":"Renegade Hardware","release":"HWARE22","track_type":"recording","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":"http://youtu.be/mfG3lenjHjA","bpm":null,"release_year":2012,"release_month":9,"release_day":10,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59930071","user":{"id":51145,"kind":"user","permalink":"maztek","username":"Maztek","last_modified":"2016/08/08 13:46:18 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/51145","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/maztek","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000215959830-9mfhjj-large.jpg"},"label":{"id":27942,"kind":"user","permalink":"renegade-hardware","username":"Renegade Hardware","last_modified":"2016/04/29 11:50:36 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/27942","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/renegade-hardware","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000044414884-bsoias-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/maztek/maztek-galactica-crissy-criss","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000030357796-zkrxoa-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/VI90IgkCGWAR_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59930071/stream","playback_count":2959,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":95,"comment_count":28,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/59930071/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":45204232,"created_at":"2012/05/03 19:05:46 +0000","user_id":14736704,"duration":121462,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":1941838,"last_modified":"2015/08/11 11:01:12 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"distant_future drum&bass techstep","permalink":"distant-future-m-zine-scepticz","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"https://pro.beatport.com/track/sinister-original-mix/4640230","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"drum and bass","title":"Distant Future & M-zine, Scepticz -

DJ Hype and Pascal are proud to bring you this release on their seminal label, once again pushing boundaries when it comes to new music. Need For Mirrors have been establishing themselves as a production force to be reckoned with and this time have teamed up with the mighty Playaz Recordings for these exclusive tracks.\r\n\r\nVimana is not what you'd expect to hear from a Playaz track but since when has that stopped them from dropping a collection of varied Drum and Bass? Stripped back and basic when it comes to production, the rhythm is kept steady by the crisp percussion which echoes around the room and gives off a soft industrial feel to the track. The opening section of Vimana incorporates soft warping synths with glittering guitar samples before reverting to a fast paced roller. No need for scaling synths and crashing cymbals here, Need For Mirrors have demonstrated how to make a steady roller which is guaranteed to cause havoc at clubs around the world.\r\n\r\nOn the flip is the techy smasher Snubnose, again, not what you'd expect but one thing you can be certain of is versatile and unique Drum and Bass. The rolling undercurrent carries the track through and is accompanied by strong, hard percussion which complements the wobbling and crashing synths superbly. Snubnose covers different styles of DnB in one track, from dark to techy and highlights the versatility of both Playaz Recordings and Need For Mirrors themselves. \r\n\r\nAfter six months of seminal releases, Playaz Recordings are certainly not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. For real Drum and Bass, keep it Real Playaz!

Having reached an incredible 20 years in the game, Ram have opened their doors to fresh styles and an exciting roster of talent for Program’s release schedule. Kicked off with Frankee’s debut solo single, this new project looks set to become a staple diet of drum & bass DJs across the globe.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from Frankee’s single come one of the scene’s most well known and loved production collectives. Having racked up releases on the biggest and brightest drum & bass labels, it makes perfect sense to add them to Program’s roster, and Wickaman, Hoodlum, Mavrik & RV do not disappoint as they bring with them two outstanding tracks packed with musical promise.\r\n\r\nFirst up ‘One Scratch’ takes you on an epic journey filled with beautiful, wide open soundscapes. Yearning vocals and long, drawn out pads pull you gently in as progressive melodies build and grow towards the drop. A drop that works effortlessly against the stunning backdrop already painted by Wickaman, Hoodlum & Mavrik, underpinning the whole track with a warm bassline and plenty of low sub-bass. This one will undoubtedly have clubbers losing themselves on the dance floor whenever it is dropped.\r\n\r\nThen Wickaman & RV take to the studio for another incredible piece of drum & bass music in the form of ‘Sound Clash’.

Having proven their worth with a decade and a half of success, the duo take their unique sound and apply it to two haunting tracks that are sure to get fans of expertly crafted D&B excited for the forthcoming long player.\n\nLeading the way is ‘Elevate This Sound’ a beautifully constructed piece of music that underpins a fully structured song complete with one of the finest vocals to ever grace a drum & bass record. Skipping beats are underpinned with layers of Rhodes organs, subtly effected emotions and a moving bassline which ensures this track will be as at home on dance floors worldwide as it is on your mp3 player.\n\nFlip over and Calyx & TeeBee offer up a track that bears their signature hallmarks infused with a fresh feel. ‘Hurting’ is packed with the kinds of twists, turns and downright gut-wrenching basslines you’ve come to expect from this duo.

Having proven their worth with a decade and a half of success, the duo take their unique sound and apply it to two haunting tracks that are sure to get fans of expertly crafted D&B excited for the forthcoming long player.\n\nLeading the way is ‘Elevate This Sound’ a beautifully constructed piece of music that underpins a fully structured song complete with one of the finest vocals to ever grace a drum & bass record. Skipping beats are underpinned with layers of Rhodes organs, subtly effected emotions and a moving bassline which ensures this track will be as at home on dance floors worldwide as it is on your mp3 player.\n\nFlip over and Calyx & TeeBee offer up a track that bears their signature hallmarks infused with a fresh feel. ‘Hurting’ is packed with the kinds of twists, turns and downright gut-wrenching basslines you’ve come to expect from this duo. Stepping drums and grinding bass notes are interspersed with haunting vocal snippets and plenty of the signature sound that will keep the drum & bass elite happy.\n\nCalyx & TeeBee - Elevate This Sound / Hurting\n\nVinyl Tracks\t\nA.

A worldwide dance music institution, Andy C and Scott Bourne’s record label has gone from strength to strength, having nurtured a plethora of the bass music scene’s most exciting artists over the last two decades.\r\n\r\nOne such artist is Culture Shock. A Ram Records star since his debut release in 2006, this incredible producer has collaborated with Sub Focus and Brookes Brothers and remixed Nero’s ‘Guilt’ and Netsky’s brand new single ‘Come Alive’ into veritable drum & bass anthems. Meanwhile his solo productions have turned dance floors across the globe upside down thanks to his powerful productions and inimitable approach to D&B.\r\n\r\nHere Culture Shock follows up last year’s ‘Protection’ with another stunning single that’s sure to please fans of his unique style. ‘I Remember’ is progressive dance floor drum & bass at its finest. Gradually building and growing, pulling you in gently and never letting go, this track is the perfect balance of beautiful musicality and effortless, uninhibited energy. Fans of Culture Shock’s sound will be instantly infatuated with this one.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile ‘Troglodyte’ demonstrates Culture Shock’s deeper and darker side perfectly. Rolling and bouncing along with a squelching bassline and chopped up vocal snippets this Caveman style skull smasher threatens to bash anything in its path with an immense bassline club, expertly crafted for maximum floor-shaking damage.\r\n\r\nCulture Shock\r\n\r\nA: I Remember\r\nAA: Troglodyte \r\n\r\nDate: 2nd July 2012\r\nCat:\tRAMM117\r\n","label_name":"RAM Records","release":"RAMM117","track_type":null,"key_signature":null,"isrc":null,"video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":2012,"release_month":7,"release_day":2,"original_format":"mp3","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/48275248","user":{"id":434854,"kind":"user","permalink":"ramrecords","username":"RAM Records","last_modified":"2016/05/18 09:21:53 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/434854","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000182048273-qa289q-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/ramrecords/culture-shock-i-remember","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000024315094-v88y9j-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/N4Uy7ciiw6FW_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/48275248/stream","playback_count":39474,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":809,"comment_count":91,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/48275248/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":48282671,"created_at":"2012/06/01 14:27:43 +0000","user_id":116681,"duration":269869,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":10790746,"last_modified":"2016/05/20 00:38:13 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"noisia \"liquid stranger\" friendly intentions vsn011 bootleg remix","permalink":"noisia-friendly-intentions-remix","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://www.noisia.nl/gold","label_id":null,"purchase_title":"Click to download","genre":"Drumstep","title":"Noisia - Friendly Intentions (Liquid Stranger Remix)","description":"Download this remix for free at: http://www.noisia.nl/gold/\r\n\r\nA Drumstep remix of Friendly Intentions!

NickBee & Malk - Cosmos\n\nINVSB005 Press Release: \nNickBee, or Nikolai Bogomolov to his friends, has been the staple diet of discerning drum & bass fans the world over for some time now. Having already released a steady stream of \ndeep, dark and disturbingly good tracks, this Ukrainian producer is ready to show just why the likes of Ed Rush & Optical, The Upbeats and Invisible label owners Noisia have been jumping on his sound.\n\nHis EP for Invisible offers a range of moods and flavours. The opening expanses of 'Discovery', the first of two tracks produced with fellow-Ukrainian Sunchase, lead you in gently offering muted bass sounds and juddering sound FX. 'Mangup' also features Sunchase, and here the pair take you deep into an epic off-world experience. Chanting vocals are offset with sharp breakbeats and digital crunches of bass that create an inevitable and irresistible tension.\n\nSides C and D see Nickbee team up with Malk.

A pure, no nonsense bassline roll out. Keeping the elements sparse and concise to allow a thick sub bass to emerge and evolve, underpinned by a stepping minimal groove. A track with real cross over credentials easily finding favour in a diverse selection of DJ’s sets already from Marky and Break through to Raiden and Vicious Circle.\n \nFor the 2nd track we journey into slightly darker territory with Scientist. Initiated with distinct and ominous old skool pads, which set the mood. The vibe is quickly updated with cut up vox provided by Fokus, which develops the track further in preparation for the drop, which unleashes contorting tech reeces, and razor sharp, chiselled drums.

Tribal drums, atomic subs, springboard delays and warning chants all carve out a seriously heavyweight riddim that chugs out effortlessly from start-to-finish.\r\n\r\nNo Justice (Jubei Remix):\r\n\r\nAfter launching into the limelight in 2010, Jubei has rapidly become one of the most sought-after artists for any label worth its salt. His take on Total Science’s ‘No Justice’ (originally released back in 2002) has already garnered support from the likes of Goldie, Bailey & Alix Perez. Thumping two-step breaks lead the march from the get-go, giving way to abone-shaking sub, old-skool rave stabs and ragga sound-bytes.

Internet message boards have been ablaze since as eager fans digitally waxed lyrical about its crisp beats, booming bass and cheeky vocal sample.\n\nTaken from ‘Nightlife 4’, ‘Machine’ by Culture Shock is a grinding, futuristic slice of electro-driven D&amp;B that’s been top of people’s wishlists since 2008. Even now, three years later, the skills of Culture Shock makes this heavyweight track sound as relevant as it did then and is a very warm welcome addition to Ram’s vinyl catalogue.\n\nThe C side is Andy C’s side as ‘Finders Keepers’ finally gets an official release. Anyone who hung around Ram’s label nights at The End or has a copy of ‘Nightlife 3’ stashed somewhere will surely remember this one and its infectious lead riff.\n\nFinally Noisia’s 2007 take on Ram Trilogy’s classic ‘No Reality’ rounds off this EP in fine style. Easily one of the most requested Ram tracks that never made it to release, this will undoubtedly have the forums firing on all cylinders in anticipation.\n\nQuite simply this EP is the Holy Grail of Drum &amp; Bass\"\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nA.

WEDGEHEAD","description":"AVAILABLE NOW TO BUY/STREAM ->\nhttp://www.criticalmusic.com/release/critical-sound-various-artists/\n\nCritical music is a UK Drum & Bass label releasing some of the freshest breaks and beats around. Created and nurtured by Kasra, the imprint has gone from strength to strength over recent years. 2009 has seen this continuing with massive releases such as the Break Remix of Spectrasoul's Alibi and Sabre's glorious Original Sin.\n\nTo usher the Autumn in, Critical Music are proud to announce the forthcoming release of their latest album project. Following on from the huge All Sounds Electric Series we bring a new concept. Eight tracks from the hottest producers in Drum and Bass right now, housed in a deluxe gatefold package and a double CD, again in deluxe packaging featuring the eight tracks from the vinyl on one disc and eleven brand new tracks on the second disc.\n\nEach track on this album encapsulates all that is great and good about underground Drum and Bass. From the blissful beat workout of Break's \"People Are Different\" to the blistering tech infused funk of Spectrasoul's 'Wedgehead'. A storming selection of the cream of today's scene.\n\nThe CD package combines the vinyl tracks with a whole extra disc of fresh material. Dubstep champ Ramadanman comes with his own brand of stripped down dnb, Russian new kid Enei brings the future flavour and we are privy to the first ever solo production from label boss Kasra with his own track perception.\n\nThis is the Critical Sound...","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":null,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"unknown","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/652542","user":{"id":33226,"kind":"user","permalink":"critical-music","username":"Critical Music","last_modified":"2016/07/11 12:05:48 +0000","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/33226","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/critical-music","avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000142989365-le0sk3-large.jpg"},"user_playback_count":1,"user_favorite":true,"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/critical-music/spectrasoul-wedgehead","artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000000582755-nxyd1d-large.jpg","waveform_url":"https://w1.sndcdn.com/BiD7HBVbDmy2_m.png","stream_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/652542/stream","playback_count":5079,"download_count":0,"favoritings_count":166,"comment_count":27,"attachments_uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/652542/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":4210222,"created_at":"2010/07/26 13:52:40 +0000","user_id":116681,"duration":180443,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":4325790,"last_modified":"2015/09/09 19:41:36 +0000","sharing":"public","tag_list":"noisia \"alix perez\" observer dnb invisible recordings","permalink":"alix-perez-the-observer-invisible002","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"https://www.beatport.com/en-US/html/content/release/detail/289617/Invisible%20002%20EP","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Drum & bass","title":"Alix Perez -
